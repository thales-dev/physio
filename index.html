						David helped me with a hip injury that I got while training for a marathon. It got worst the more I ran and running became uncomfortable and frustrating. I reached out to David for an online physio consultation during lockdown as I needed running more than ever. David was professional, friendly, knowledgeable & very efficient - he really listened to the details of my problem and was able to diagnose the issue right away. Following the bespoke rehabilitation plan set out for me within 3 weeks the issue was corrected- I went from dragging my leg on longer runs with bad front hip pain to running pain-free and enjoying running again thanks to David.

						David helped me through the quarantine with online physio. I had developed knee pain from excessive running and David was able to explain what was wrong and he was able to personalise a program for me. In a matter of weeks my knee felt great and I was able to return to running. Thank you David. His advice was spot on and I'm still sticking with his exercise plan even thoughI I have no pain. He was so professional and he did a few follow ups to see how I was getting on. Could not recommend this guy enough üëçüëçüëèüëè
